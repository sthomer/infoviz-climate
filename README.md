# Exploring Climate Change
> Information Visualization Project

## Development Quickstart Installation
* Navigate to the `app` directory and run `npm install` to automatically install dependencies
  * This requires `node` and `npm` to already be installed
* Run `npm start` to start the development server
* Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser to view the app

## Development Guidelines
* When developing your portion, create your own `js` and `jsx` files
* `App.jsx` will link these different modules/visualizations together with imports
* Try not to share state across different modules i.e. yours should be pretty self-contained
* Use the `styled-components` package for styling
  * Put reusable things like headers and layouts in `styles.jsx` but custom styles should remain in same file that they are used
* Don't use bootstrap rows and cols, but feel free to use the components (e.g. buttons, navs)
